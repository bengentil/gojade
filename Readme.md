GoJade
======

An implementation of the Template Engine [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) in Go

The project has been created based on the Go text template engine [http://golang.org/src/pkg/text/template/parse/]

This package doesn't implement all the features of jade and need some code cleanup and bugfixes.
